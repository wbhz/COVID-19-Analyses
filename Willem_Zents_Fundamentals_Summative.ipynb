    "The first part will involve the use of the OxCOVID19 database (https://oxcovid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) , which has an extensive set of data not only including COVID-related data but data on world values, geographic mobility, sociodemographic data, and more. Each table can be linked to others using identifiers as discussed on the database website. You should come up with a research question, justify that research question in a literature review section (of less than 750 words), and then proceed to query the database for the relevant data which you should merge, visualise and make claims about. You do not have to include any statistics on COVID-related data itself should you wish not to. You can instead simply use the additional extensive supplementary data. You should be able to plot the merged data in such a way that it speaks to your research question and report on descriptive statistics where relevant. You are asked not to do any complex multivariate modelling. This question should be primarily descriptive in nature. Example research questions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Did areas of the world with different social values (as measured by some question on the World Values Survey) have different proportions of COVID infections in April?\n",
    "Are people in the UK more mobile on days when the weather was above average? Did this hold during lockdown?\n",
    "Is air pressure more variable in coastal countries (or coastal regions) or inland countries (or inland regions)? You should interpret the resulting output and summarise it in a report section of not more than 750 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that the evaluators should be able to reproduce your findings by running the Jupyter notebook themselves.\n",

    "One important caveat is that this work should not require the installation of any external libraries not featured in class."

    "* Do countries with lower hospital capacity impose stricter measures?\n",
    "    * It would make sense that countries which have less capacity in their hospitals run a higher risk of getting overwhelmed by a rise of COVID cases, therefore they have less room to take risks by having looser restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bauer et al. find that \"geographical access to intensive care beds varies significantly across European countries and low ICU accessibility was associated with a higher proportion of COVID-19 deaths to cases (CFR)\". \n",
    "\n",
    "* Davies et al.: \"These studies have broadly suggested that moderate measures could reduce epidemic size, but more intensive measures would be required to ensure health system capacity was not surpassed.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Davies et al. \" Intensive interventions with lockdown periods would need to be in place for a large proportion of the coming year to prevent health-care demand exceeding availability.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sebhatu et al: Countries with higher care capacity were slower to adopt COVID-19 restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sussman: \"A smaller supply of hospital beds leads to higher mortality rates that induce governments to take more stringent closure measures that have greater economic costs. Higher mortality could also affect consumer confidence, bring about panic-driven decisions that also affect the economy adversely.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Elgin: \"This result implies that countries where the number of beds per capita is lower, more stringent economic stimulus is adopted.\"\n"

You will select an API (or direct URL) from the web which will allow you to download said data that you should merge in with the OxCOVID19 data. This second question does not need to be linked thematically to the first. Consider it like a second blog post. . You will first have to justify the choice of external data, your specific choice of API endpoints or URL, time frames or other ranges for this data. You should then report on the merged data through descriptive statistics and plots where appropriate. Data sources could include anything from reddit, Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter, StackOverflow, or another source not covered in class (as long as it is publicly available either openly or through a free registered account). You can use external libraries (such as praw) in order to collect this data. Please do not submit any private API keys with this data.

    "Do countries with longer Wikipedia pages (external) correlate with higher GDP (from the World Bank tables)?\n",

This is because the evaluators may run your code and might still want to check this with the output that you have submitted. This pdf can either be generated from JupyterLab itself if you have the appropriate LaTeX modules installed or simply by going to ‘print’ for that browser window and print to PDF.   "
