# COVID-19 Analyses

This project contains two analyses that I conducted as part of an exercise for the course Fundamentals of Social Data Science in Python at the Oxford Internet Institute in December 2020. 

Both analyses explore the link between the COVID-19 pandemic and broader societal phenomena using basic statistical analysis and visualization techniques. 

# Analysis and Dataset

For this project, I rely on data from the OxCOVID-19 Database as well as data from Yahoo Finance, Google Trends, and the Guardian, which I collected through APIs. 

# Notebooks

- `Hospital_Capacity.ipynb` - This notebook contains a latitudinal analysis of the relationship between hospital capacity and Covid measure stringency in different countries. 
- `StockMarket_Covid.ipynb` - This notebook contains an analysis of the role of different sources of Covid-related information in the stock market's response to the pandemic.
