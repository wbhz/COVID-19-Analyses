# COVID-19 Analyses

This project contains two analyses that I conducted as part of an exercise for the course Fundamentals of Social Data Science in Python at the Oxford Internet Institute in December 2020. 

Both analyses explore the link between the COVID-19 pandemic and broader societal phenomena using basic statistical analysis and visualization techniques.
